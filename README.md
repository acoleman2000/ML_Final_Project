# ML Final Project

This readme contains code and data for our final project.

data directory contains data for our attempt 1, and data_2 contains data for our attempt 2.

`create_signals.py`, `generate_data.py`, `generate_images.py`, `plotting.py` and `insert_signals.py` are responsible for generating our test data. `insert_signals.py` is the user facing application, and more details can be found running `python insert_signals.py -h`.

`models.py` has all our machine learning models defined in classes.
